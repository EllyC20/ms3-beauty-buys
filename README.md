# Beauty Buys

Am I Responsive Image Here

Beauty Buys is a review site, where users can upload their own reviews of beauty products. Due to Covid-19 many people have had to tighten
their purses, and pay closer attention to where their money is going. By having a site where users can read about products before purchasing
ensures money is not wasted on unsuitable products. The aim is that a community of people with a common interest will be developed and 
people can have fun learning and reviewing.
