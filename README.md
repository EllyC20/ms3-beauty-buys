# Beauty Buys

Am I Responsive Image Here

Beauty Buys is a review site, where users can upload their own reviews of beauty products. Due to Covid-19 many people have had to tighten
their purses, and pay closer attention to where their money is going. By having a site where users can read about products before purchasing
ensures money is not wasted on unsuitable products. The aim is that a community of people with a common interest will be developed and 
people can have fun learning and reviewing.

### 1.Strategy 

**Project Purpose**

* This project is intended to allow people to review products, learn about new products and share a common interest. 

### 2.Scope

* The sites function should be immediately clear to the user. 
* The interface should be appealing, subtle and not too busy with features or design.
* The user should not feel that the uploading of a review is too difficult as they may then leave the site.
* All information regarding reviews should be easily accessible and the user should not find it hard to reach this information.

### 3.Structure

** As A New User (Not Logged In)**

* A user who is not logged in, can reach four pages;
* Home / Index
* Reviews - cannot upload a review.
* Register 
* Log In 

** As A Registered User (Logged In)** 

* A user who is logged in, can reach four pages;
* Home / Index 
* Reviews - can edit or delete own reviews.
* Edit Review - once user has chosen to edit a review. 
* Log Out

* The Navbar provides access to these pages on all devices. This Navbar collapses to a Side Navbar on mobile devices.
* The Footer contains Social Media links which the site owner can use to link to their accounts.

### 4.Skeleton

 Desktop wireframes can be viewed ![here](readme-and-testing-images/ms3-desktop.pdf)

 * The first wireframe shows the homepage, as a user who is not logged in.
 * The second wireframe shows the homepage, as a user who is logged in.
 * The third and fourth wireframe shows the review page, as a user who is not logged in. 
 * The fifth wireframe shows the register page. 
 * The sixth wireframe shows the login page. 

 ** When viewing the wireframes there are some changes that should be noted, they are detailed below. **
 
 * The Homepage wireframe, shows a button featured on the opening image. Once I had designed and implemented the Navigation
 Bar the button felt like an unneccessary feature. The purpose was to allow the user to click the button to register, but with 
 the user being able to select "Register" in the Nav Bar, this fulfilled this purpose.

 * The Reviews page differed from my original wireframe. In my wireframe I thought I would use an accordion element to display the reviews. This 
 would have meant when the user opened the review page they would only have seen the product name and then expanded the rest of the review detail. 
 Upon implementing I felt this didn't give the user a good experience, it wasn't visually appealing and I decided a card reveal would be better. 
 By choosing to do this, the user visits the review page and is immediately shown a photo of the product being reviewed and the product name. The user
 can then expand this detail but rather than pushing the rest of the page down, the review slides up and the user can read the detail, close it and move on 
 to the next review they would like to read. 

 * The implementation of both the Register and Login pages differed, the image to the top of the page felt more appropiate and followed conventional design along with
  the layout of the rest of the site.

### Feautures To Be Implemented

* In the future a feature could be added where a user could use their smartphone camera to scan a products barcode to provide product name 
  and details quickly, then they would only need to upload a reiew.
